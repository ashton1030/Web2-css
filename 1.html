                <p style="color:chocolate">
                    C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language created 
                    by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or 
                    "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, 
                    and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features 
                    in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost
                    always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, 
                    including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, 
                    so it is available on many platforms.[9]
