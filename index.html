                <h3>Cumputer Programming</h3>
                <p style="color:chocolate">
                    Computer programming is the process of designing and building 
                    an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing 
                    result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks 
                    such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' 
                    accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of 
                    algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).
                    [1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages 
                    that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is 
                    directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming 
                    is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of 
                    a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often 
                    for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise 
                    in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, 
                    specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
